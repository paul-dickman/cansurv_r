# cansurv_r
This repository contains R code for exercises from the short course [http://cansurv.net/](Statistical methods for population-based cancer survival analysis). 

The course uses Stata as the primary software. The [http://cansurv.net/](course faculty) are not experts in R, but assist course participants in implementing methods and solving exercises in R. 

This repository contains R code written by course participants. We hope course participants who work in R will upload their code here so it can be of benefit to other course participants (and the research community who wish to implement these methods in R).

There is a discussion forum, which we hope will be used to discuss how to best organise and use the repository, as well as how to implement methods for population-based cancer survival in R.

The first versions of the R solutions files were all created by [https://enochytchen.com/](Enoch Yi-Tung Chen).
